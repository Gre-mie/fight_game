# About

This project was made as a submission to [Boot.dev Personal Project](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-personal-project-1)

Pick options from a menu to battle enemies until all enemies are defeated or the player health reaches zero.

## Run the game

Because I will continue to work on this game, some setup is needed to play a working version.
After cloneing the repo be sure to run `setup.sh`
`setup.sh` will branch off the last working release and switch to that branch
Setup will only need to be run when you update the cloned repo

Use `./main.sh` from the project root of the branch created by `setup.sh` to start playing

### Trouble shooting

**NOTE**: This game was made using WSL and may not work as intended in some terminal environments.

Some environments may not have all the features used by the game code. for example VScode doesn't have blinking mode

`main.sh` and `setup.sh` need exicute permissions to run.<br>
You can check exicute permissions with `ls -l`<br>
